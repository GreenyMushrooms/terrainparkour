How this code and game works:
=====================

* see this youtube video <todo> here


What you can do with this
=====================

* it should be moderately easy to get the basics of this into a roblox game and test variations in warping, running, movement.
* but, replacing 



what isn't working
=====================

* removed secrets, which means you even if you put this into a roblox game using Rojo, it won't work because you won't be able to construct the remote URL.  Also  even if you had this, youd be writing to the main db.

* removed badgeCheckers, which means every time you try to check a badge it won't work. This should be easily fixable by adding a fake badgechecker.

* removed backend - the endpoints which actually save and provide data to the callers to store runs, do commands, etc.

What's coming
===============

An easier way for you to use this.

This, but in a semi-working uncopylocked Roblox game, so you could make your own landscape, signs, etc and at least play with it in a way.


What you can do
=================

If you do get it working, getting pull requests for the open issues would be nice.

i.e. fixing sounds, movement, animations should be lower hanging fruit.
